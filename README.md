# Nao-Robot-demo
This is a simple demo for the university open day. The Nao robot could introduce himself and if you touch his hand, he will start dancing Taichi. 
Note: There's a connection issue between Choregraphe and robot. So the first thing you need to do is [download the robot setting app in linux system:] (https://www.aldebaran.com/en/support/nao-6/downloads-softwares.)
1. Linux system, the robot setting is located in `/opt/robot_settings`. Run `sudo ./robot_settings`. Use the cable connect the robot and the router, the robot setting can find the robot then.
2. Find the Choregraphe in `/opt/Softbank Robotics/Choregraphe Suite 2.8`. Run `sudo ./choregraphe`.
